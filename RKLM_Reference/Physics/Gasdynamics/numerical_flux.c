 Revision 1.2  1998/03/07 09:56:47  nicola
 Added flux computation and multiple pressure variables.
 
 Revision 1.1  1998/03/01 18:43:35  nicola
 This is the initial revision of 3d. It comes out after two weeks of work on
 Matthias' version of Rupert's F3D code. It is the starting point for imple
 menting a low Mach number extension.
